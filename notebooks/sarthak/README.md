Met with our TA to discuss our project proposal and steps to take next. Main concerns with the report were high level objectives, block diagram blue lines, and  having a more concrete structure for the substem description section. We inquired about if the camera part we need is already in the lab. We now have access to a rasberry pi3 and all the supporting hardware to install the OS on the Pi.
